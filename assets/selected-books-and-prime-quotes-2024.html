          <p>Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back to a level below thought, the level of an animal or a plant. In the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind when needed, but in a much more focused and effective way than before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary internal dialogue, and there is inner stillness. When you do use your mind, and particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillate every few minutes or so between thought and stillness, between mind and no-mind. No-mind is consciousness without thought. Only in that way is it possible to think creatively, because only in that way does thought have any real power. Thought alone, when it is no longer connected with the much vaster realm of consciousness, quickly becomes barren, insane, destructive.</p>
          <p>Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being or rather three aspects of the state of inner connectedness with Being. As such, they have no opposite. This is because they arise from beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being part of the dualistic mind, are subject to the law of opposites. This simply means that you cannot have good without bad. So in the unenlightened, mind-identified condition, what is sometimes wrongly called joy is the usually short-lived pleasure side of the continuously alternating pain/pleasure cycle. Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn into its opposite at the flick of a switch. Many "love" relationships, after the initial euphoria has passed, actually oscillate between "love" and hate, attraction and attack.</p>
          <p>Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say "yes" to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to something that already is? What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say "yes" to life&mdash;and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you.</p>
          <p>Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.</p>
          <p>Watch out for any sign of unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form&mdash;it may be the awakening pain-body. This can take the form of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire to hurt, anger, rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your relationship, and so on. Catch it the moment it awakens from its dormant state.</p>
          <p>Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don't think about it&mdash;don't let the feeling turn into thinking. Don't judge or analyze. Don't make an identity for yourself out of it.</p>
          <p>To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and allow it to be. The compulsion arises because the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.</p>
          <p>Time isn't precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on time&mdash;past and future&mdash;the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is.</p>
          <p>Why is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because it is the only thing. It's all there is. The eternal present is the space within which your whole life unfolds, the one factor that remains constant. Life is now. There was never a time when your life was not now, nor will there ever be. Secondly, the Now is the only point that can take you beyond the limited confines of the mind. It is your only point of access into the timeless and formless realm of Being.</p>
          <p>Make it your practice to withdraw attention from past and future whenever they are not needed. Step out of the time dimension as much as possible in everyday life. If you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing the habitual tendency of your mind to want to escape from the Now. You will observe that the future is usually imagined as either better or worse than the present. If the imagined future is better, it gives you hope or pleasurable anticipation. If it is worse, it creates anxiety. Both are illusory. Through self-observation, more presence comes into your life automatically. The moment you realize you are not present, you are present.</p>
          <p>If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time. You are aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest attention to the step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to "make it." You no longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are present in the Now.</p>
          <p>Usually, the future is a replica of the past. Superficial changes are possible, but real transformation is rare and depends upon whether you can become present enough to dissolve the past by accessing the power of the Now. What you perceive as future is an intrinsic part of your state of consciousness now. If your mind carries a heavy burden of past, you will experience more of the same. The past perpetuates itself through lack of presence. The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future&mdash;which, of course, can only be experienced as the Now.</p>
          <p>All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry&mdash;all forms of fear&mdash;are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.</p>
          <p>Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don't judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something&mdash;anything&mdash;and feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and without. Allow the "isness" of all things. Move deeply into the Now.</p>
          <p>"Problem" means that you are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a true intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of life, of Being. Or you are carrying in your mind the insane burden of a hundred things that you will or may have to do in the future instead of focusing your attention on the one thing that you can do now.</p>
          <p>If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. "How" is always more important than "what." See if you can give much more attention to the doing than to the result that you want to achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This implies that you also completely accept what is, because you cannot give your full attention to something and at the same time resist it.</p>
          <p>To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment.</p>
          <p>Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation. "Am I at ease at this moment?" is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or you can ask: "What's going on inside me at this moment?" Be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. But don't answer these questions immediately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you detect that there is a low level of unease, the background static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or denying life&mdash;by denying the Now.</p>
          <p>Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences. No excuses. No negativity. No psychic pollution. Keep your inner space clear.</p>
          <p>Stress is caused by being "here" but wanting to be "there," or being in the present but wanting to be in the future. It's a split that tears you apart inside. To create and live with such an inner split is insane. The fact that everyone else is doing it doesn't make it any less insane. If you have to, you can move fast, work fast, or even run, without protecting yourself into the future and without resisting the present. As you move, work, run&mdash;do it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy, the high energy of that moment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting yourself in two. Just moving, running, working&mdash;and enjoying it. Or you can drop the whole thing and sit on a park bench. But when you do, watch your mind. It may say: "You should be working. You are wasting time." Observe the mind. Smile at it.</p>
          <p>Are you worried? Do you have many "what if" thoughts? You are identified with your mind, which is projecting itself into an imaginary future situation and creating fear. There is no way that you can cope with such a situation, because it doesn't exist. It's a mental phantom. You can stop this health- and life-corroding insanity simply by acknowledging the present moment. Become aware of your breathing. Feel the air flowing in and out of your body. Feel your inner energy field. All that you ever have to deal with, cope with, in real life&mdash;as opposed to imaginary mind projections&mdash;is this moment. Ask yourself what "problem" you have right now, not next year, tomorrow, or five minutes from now. What is wrong with this moment? You can always cope with the Now, but you can never cope with the future&mdash;nor do you have to. The answer, the strength, the right action or the resource will be there when you need it, not before, not after.</p>
          <p>Are you a habitual "waiter"? How much of your life do you spend waiting? What I call "small-scale waiting" is waiting in line at the post office, in a traffic jam, at the airport, or waiting for someone to arrive, to finish work, and so on. "Large-scale waiting" is waiting for the next vacation, for a better job, for the children to grow up, for a truly meaningful relationship, for success, to make money, to be important, to become enlightened. It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living.</p>
          <p>Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future; you don't want the present. You don't want what you've got, and you want what you haven't got. With every kind of waiting, you unconsciously create inner conflict between your here and now, where you don't want to be, and the projected future, where you want to be. This greatly reduces the quality of your life by making you lose the present.</p>
          <p>The more attention you give to the past, the more you energize it, and the more likely you are to make a "self" out of it. Don't misunderstand: Attention is essential, but not to the past as past. Give attention to the present; give attention to your behavior, to your reactions, moods, thoughts, emotions, fears, and desires as they occur in the present. There's the past in you. If you can be present enough to watch all those things, not critically or analytically but nonjudgmentally, then you are dealing with the past and dissolving it through the power of your presence. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You find yourself by coming into the present.</p>
          <p>Have you ever gazed up into the infinity of space on a clear night, awestruck by the absolute stillness and inconceivable vastness of it? Have you listened, truly listened, to the sound of a mountain stream in the forest? Or to the song of a blackbird at dusk on a quiet summer evening? To become aware of such things, the mind needs to be still. You have to put down for a moment your personal baggage of problems, of past and future, as well as all your knowledge; otherwise, you will see but not see, hear but not hear. Your total presence is required.</p>
          <p>Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By all means focus on what you are doing, but feel the inner body at the same time whenever possible. Stay rooted within. Then observe how this changes your state of consciousness and the quality of what you are doing.</p>
          <p>When you become identified more with the timeless inner body than with the outer body, when presence becomes your normal mode of consciousness and past and future no longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate time anymore in your psyche and in the cells of the body. The accumulation of time as the psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cells' capacity for self-renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old at a much slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shine through the outer form, and you will not give the appearance of an old person.</p>
          <p>The more consciousness you bring into the body, the stronger the immune system becomes. It is as if every cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your attention. It is also a potent form of self-healing.</p>
          <p>It is not only your physical immune system that becomes strengthened; your psychic immune system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protects you from the negative mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highly contagious. Inhabiting the body protects you not by putting up a shield, but by raising the frequency vibration of your total energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists in what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn't enter your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don't need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you.</p>
          <p>There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective if used when you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus. It will also counteract any disruption of your energy field by some form of negativity.</p>
          <p>When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, "flood" your body with consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present in every cell of your body. Don't be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in drawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to the inner body.</p>
          <p>If at any time you are finding it hard to get in touch with the inner body, it is usually easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful meditation in its own right, will gradually put you in touch with the body. Follow the breath with your attention as it moves in and out of your body. Breathe into the body, and feel your abdomen expanding and contracting slightly with each inhalation and exhalation.</p>
          <p>Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness.</p>
          <p>Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peace does not.</p>
          <p>The happiness that is derived from some secondary source is never very deep. It is only a pale reflection of the joy of Being, the vibrant peace that you find within as you enter the state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polar opposites of the mind and frees you from dependency on form. Even if everything were to collapse and crumble all around you, you would still feel a deep inner core of peace. You may not be happy, but you will be at peace.</p>
          <p>Having gone beyond the mind-made opposites, you become like a deep lake. The outer situation of your life and whatever happens there, is the surface of the lake. Sometimes calm, sometimes windy and rough, according to the cycles and seasons. Deep down, however, the lake is always undisturbed. You are the whole lake, not just the surface, and you are in touch with your own depth, which remains absolutely still. You don't resist change by mentally clinging to any situation. Your inner peace does not depend on it. You abide in Being&mdash;unchanging, timeless, deathless&mdash;and you are no longer dependent for fulfillment or happiness on the outer world of constantly fluctuating forms. You can enjoy them, play with them, create new forms, appreciate the beauty of it all. But there will be no need to attach yourself to any of it.</p>
          <p>The only place where you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Inner resistance is to say "no" to what is, through mental judgment and emotional negativity. It becomes particularly pronounced when things "go wrong," which means that there is a gap between the demands or rigid expectations of your mind and what is. That is the pain gap. If you have lived long enough, you will know that things "go wrong" quite often. It is precisely at those times that surrender needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain and sorrow from your life. Acceptance of what is immediately frees you from mind identification and thus reconnects you with Being. Resistance is the mind.</p>
          <p>Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does not mean that on the outer level you cannot take action and change the situation. In fact, it is not the overall situation that you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segment called the Now.</p>
          <p>Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action, initiating change or achieving goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different energy, a different quality, flows into your doing. Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of Being, and if your doing is infused with Being, it becomes a joyful celebration of life energy that takes you more deeply into the Now. Through nonresistance, the quality of your consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. The results will then look after themselves and reflect that quality.</p>
          <p>If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, separate out this instant and surrender to what is.</p>
          <p>Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, "Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?" If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the 100 things that you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn't mean you should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don't start to run "mental movies," project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does&mdash;do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.</p>
          <p>Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of "I can't be bothered anymore" or "I just don't care anymore." If you look at it closely, you will find that such an attitude is tainted with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so is not surrender at all but masked resistance. As you surrender, direct your attention inward to check if there is any trace of resistance left inside you. Be very alert when you do so; otherwise, a pocket of resistance may continue to hide in some dark corner in the form of a thought or an unacknowledged emotion.</p>
          <p>If you cannot surrender, take action immediately: Speak up or do something to bring about a change in the situation&mdash;or remove yourself from it. Take responsibility for your life. Do not pollute your beautiful, radiant inner Being nor the Earth with negativity. Do not give unhappiness in any form whatsoever a dwelling place inside you.</p>
          <p>Your first chance is to surrender each moment to the reality of that moment. Knowing that what is cannot be undone&mdash;because it already is&mdash;you say yes to what is or accept what isn't. Then you do what you have to do, whatever the situation requires. If you abide in this state of acceptance, you create no more negativity, no more suffering, no more unhappiness. You then live in a state of nonresistance, a state of grace and lightness, free of struggle.</p>
          <p>Whenever you are unable to do that, whenever you miss that chance&mdash;either because you are not generating enough conscious presence to prevent some habitual and unconscious resistance pattern from arising, or because the condition is so extreme as to be absolutely unacceptable to you&mdash;then you are creating some form of pain, some form of suffering. It may look as if the situation is creating the suffering, but ultimately this is not so&mdash;your resistance is.</p>
          <p>Now here is your second chance at surrender: If you cannot accept what is outside, then accept what is inside. If you cannot accept the external condition, accept the internal condition. This means: Do not resist the pain. Allow it to be there. Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever form the suffering takes. Witness it without labeling it mentally. Embrace it. Then see how the miracle of surrender transmutes deep suffering into deep peace. This is your crucifixion. Let it become your resurrection and ascension.</p>
          <p>You cannot truly forgive yourself or others as long as you derive your sense of self from the past. Only through accessing the power of the Now, which is your own power, can there be true forgiveness. This renders the past powerless, and you realize deeply that nothing you ever did or that was ever done to you could touch even in the slightest the radiant essence of who you are. The whole concept of forgiveness then becomes unnecessary.</p>

      <p>Authentic people know themselves and their motivations; they own their decisions and take responsibility in such a way that they will stand up against social pressures and speak the truth as it seems to them, and, in their day-to-day life, they will come across to others as transparent, honest, and genuine.</p>
  <p>Know yourself + Own yourself + Be yourself = the Authentic Life</p>
      <p>To have both needs for agency and belonging met in our relationships provides us with the magic mix that allows us to flourish. The perfect caregiving relationships for children are characterised by unconditional positive regard where the children are loved for who they are, no matter what they do. Surrounded by unconditional positive regard, they are free to be themselves, to be the agents of their own explorations into the world and yet they will know that they are accepted and valued. With their basic psychological needs met, children will flourish and develop in such a way as to realise their unique potentials. The authentic parent finds the right balance such that their child's needs for belonging and agency are equally met. Authentic parents offer their children the freedom to be themselves and to remain loved for being themselves.</p>
  <p>Authenticity is when we are able to tune out from the external messages telling us what should be important to us so that we can reprioritise our goals and values in a way that is consistent with our own inner voice, which will guide us towards intrinsic goals and values.</p>
  <p>Mindful breathing can be useful at any time during the day when you need to slow down, regain focus, or deal with stressful feelings.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>First, make sure you are comfortable and safe. Now breathe in slowly through your nose.</li>
          <li>Hold your breath for a count of six.</li>
          <li>Slowly breathe out through your mouth, imagining your breath flowing out into the atmosphere.</li>
          <li>Repeat this sequence ten times. Just focus on your breathing and nothing else for that one minute.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is about noticing things in the world around us. In the rush of everyday life, it is easy not to notice what is around us.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Choose a tree or a flower that you can see.</li>
          <li>Watch it for five minutes.</li>
          <li>Don't do anything else but observe the tree or flower. Notice every aspect.</li>
          <li>When you are ready, expand your awareness further by closing your eyes and listening for two minutes to all the sounds around you.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you build up your ability to be mindful, you will find yourself introducing it into your everyday life more and more.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Choose a daily activity, such as leaving the house in the morning to go to work or going round the supermarket. Your task is to go through your daily actions completely aware of what you are doing and focused on the present moment. The way to do this is to say to yourself, "I've got a lot on my mind right now, but for the moment I need to focus my attention 100 percent on what I'm doing right now and do that and nothing else."</li>
          <li>If you find your attention wandering as you do these everyday tasks, it might help you if you talk to yourself as you go to describe what you are doing: "I'm picking up my bag. Now I'm checking my keys are inside. I'm opening the door. Now I'm locking the door behind me." Straightforward as that sounds, it will keep you focused on what you are doing and mindful of the present moment.</li>
          <li>As you get better at being mindful of your daily activities, you may begin to also observe what's going on inside you as you go through the day. If you can observe your feelings from a detached point of view, you will not be consumed, in the moment, by the feelings themselves. Instead of being at the mercy of your emotions, you will become in control of how you react to your thoughts.</li>
          <li>Practise relating to your inner experiences in a new and different way. Observe your thoughts as if they are words on a screen&mdash;simply observe them in a detached way. The point is to be able to take a non-judgemental approach to engaging with your experiences, to simply be curious, open and accepting of our thoughts and feelings.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Don't be lavish in praising your children about things over which they have no control, such as intelligence, physical attractiveness, or athletic or artistic gifts. Instead, direct your praise to areas over which your children can exert effort and take ownership, such as their attitude to a task, the level of responsibility they assume, their commitment, compassion, generosity to others and so on.</p>
  <p>Authentic people are good listeners. They don't pretend to listen while waiting their turn to talk. They do listen, because whatever you say won't be felt as a challenge to them personally. They are aware of what's going on inside themselves emotionally. They will want to understand better your point of view and how you are feeling and will ask questions and take responsibility for their actions.</p>
  <p>A manifesto for authentic living with yourself:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Know your own boundaries and be clear to others what is acceptable to you and what isn't.</li>
          <li>Use each and every challenge in life as an opportunity to learn about yourself.</li>
          <li>Be aware of how you feel in the moment and question why those feelings have come about.</li>
          <li>Listen carefully to your initial gut reactions and what it is you are telling yourself. Try to distinguish your inner voice of wisdom.</li>
          <li>Learn to accept yourself just as you are.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A manifesto for authentic living with others:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Don't focus on what others lack; do something to help nurture the talents and strengths that they have.</li>
              <li>Don't keep others down; do point out the potential that they have to reach new heights.</li>
          <li>Don't try to make people be more like you; do help them become more of who they are.</li>
          <li>Don't be controlling with others, but always think of how best to support their unique directions in life.</li>
          <li>Try to understand other people's perspectives on life and listen carefully. Accept that other people are entitled to their view, even if it is different from yours.</li>

            <p>To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.</p>
            <p>If you're not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it'll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally.</p>
       <p>At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning&mdash;no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you'll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely.</p>
        <p>Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities so long as they provide similar "inherently fascinating stimuli" and freedom from directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run&mdash;the types of activities that will fill your time in the evening if you enforce a work shutdown&mdash;play the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you're robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they prevent you from reaching the levels of deeper relaxation in which attention restoration can occur. Only the confidence that you're done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.</p>
            <p>Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done. Your average e-mail response time might suffer some, but you'll more than make up for this with the sheer volume of truly important work produced during the day by your refreshed ability to dive deeper than your exhausted peers.</p>
            <p>Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.</p>
        <p>Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.</p>
        <p>Notice that this craftsman approach to tool selection stands in opposition to the any-benefit approach. Whereas the any-benefit mind-set identifies any potential positive impact as justification for using a tool, the craftsman variant requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of what's important to you and that they outweigh the negatives.</p>
        <p>The Law of the Vital Few: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.</p>
            <p>By taking the time consumed by low-impact activities&mdash;like finding old friends on Facebook&mdash;and reinvesting in high-impact activities&mdash;like taking a good friend out to lunch&mdash;you end up more successful in your goal.</p>
        <p>Put more thought into your leisure time. In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don't default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your "day within a day."</p>
